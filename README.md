# Blog Engine

## Overview

**Blog Engine** is a simple yet powerful web application that allows users to create and manage blog posts, view individual posts along with comments, and interact with the content. The admin panel enables easy management of blog posts and user comments. The project is built with **ASP.NET Core MVC**, **Entity Framework Core**, and **SQLite** for database management.

### Key Features

- **Admin Dashboard**: Provides an interface for admins to manage blog posts and comments.
- **Create, Edit, and Delete Posts**: Admins can create, edit, or delete blog posts.
- **Comment System**: Users can comment on blog posts, and admins can manage these comments by approving or deleting them.
- **Post Visibility**: Admins can control whether a post is published or not.
- **Comment Approval**: Admins can approve or delete comments.
  
## Concepts Used

- **ASP.NET Core MVC**: The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for a clean separation of concerns.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Used for interacting with the database and managing blog posts and comments.
- **Database**: SQLite is used for the development database; however, the application can be configured to work with other relational databases.
- **Asynchronous Programming**: Methods like `SaveChangesAsync` and `ToListAsync` are used for non-blocking database operations.
- **Dependency Injection**: The application uses DI to inject services such as `ILogger` and `DbContext` into controllers.
- **Validation**: Input validation is handled in the controller layer using ModelState to ensure data integrity.

## Data Flow (Backend to Frontend)

1. **Admin Dashboard (`AdminController`)**:
    - **Action**: `Index`
    - The backend fetches all blog posts asynchronously from the database (`_context.BlogPosts.ToListAsync()`) and passes them to the frontend view as a model. 
    - **Frontend**: Displays a list of blog posts in an HTML table.

2. **Create Blog Post (`Create`)**:
    - **Action**: `Create` (GET) renders a form for adding new posts.
    - **Action**: `Create` (POST) accepts data from the form, creates a new blog post in the database, and saves the changes asynchronously.
    - **Frontend**: The admin is presented with a form to input a title and content. Upon form submission, the backend processes the data and redirects the admin to the dashboard view.

3. **Edit Blog Post (`Edit`)**:
    - **Action**: `Edit` (GET) retrieves the blog post to be edited using `FindAsync`.
    - **Action**: `Edit` (POST) updates the blog post in the database if it passes validation.
    - **Frontend**: A form pre-populated with the existing post data is displayed for the admin to modify.

4. **Delete Blog Post (`Delete`)**:
    - **Action**: `Delete` fetches the post by ID and removes it from the database.
    - **Frontend**: A confirmation view is shown before the post is permanently deleted. After deletion, the admin is redirected to the dashboard.

5. **Manage Comments (`ManageComments`)**:
    - **Action**: `ManageComments` fetches all comments with their associated blog posts.
    - **Frontend**: Displays a list of comments, where each comment can be approved or deleted.
    
6. **Approve/Disapprove/Delete Comments**:
    - **Actions**: `ApproveComment`, `DeleteComment`, and `ToggleApproval` modify the status of the comments.
    - **Frontend**: Admins can approve/disapprove comments or delete them based on their content.

## Prerequisites

- **.NET 6.0 or higher**: Ensure that you have .NET installed.
- **SQLite**: The project uses SQLite by default for the database.
  
## Setup and Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/BlogEngine.git
```

### Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and restore the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd BlogEngine
dotnet restore
```

### Run the Application

To run the application locally:

```bash
dotnet run
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Database Setup

If you are running the project for the first time, you need to apply migrations to set up the database:

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

This will create the necessary tables for blog posts and comments in your SQLite database.

### Testing the Application

Once the app is running, you can access the following features:
- **Home Page**: Displays all blog posts.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Allows admins to create, edit, delete, and manage blog posts.
- **Comment System**: Allows users to add comments to posts (admin approval required).

### Running Tests

To run tests (if implemented):

```bash
dotnet test
```

## Screenshots

Include some screenshots here to illustrate the admin dashboard, blog post details page, and comment management.

## Contributing
